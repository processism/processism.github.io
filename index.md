## What is Processism?

Processism is a framework for understanding reality that emerged from a systematic analysis of patterns across many domains of human knowledge.

Rather than seeing the world primarily as a collection of objects or separate domains, Processism views it as an integrated process that generates its own complexity through recursive patterns—patterns that repeat and build upon themselves.

> "Perhaps the biggest problem humans face is that we have so many problems."

## Rethinking What We Call "Problems"

What if our persistent problems aren't things to be solved, but symptoms of limitations in how we think?

When we encounter paradoxes, contradictions, and inexplicable phenomena, we typically treat them as puzzles awaiting solutions. But what if these "problems" are actually revealing something more fundamental—that our existing frameworks themselves create these apparent contradictions?

## A Different Approach

Our research took a novel approach to understanding these persistent challenges:

We used pattern analysis across diverse domains of human knowledge to identify recurring structures that might reveal more fundamental organizing principles. 

Instead of developing yet another specialized theory, we looked for the patterns that connect all domains—from physics to biology to cognition to social systems.

## What We Discovered

This research revealed a remarkable pattern: a recursive process framework that appears across all domains of knowledge and offers extraordinary explanatory power.

Unlike frameworks that treat reality as a collection of objects or separate domains, Processism sees it as an integrated process that generates its own complexity through recursive patterns.

### The Three Core Patterns

Our research identified three fundamental patterns that appear consistently across physics, biology, cognition, information systems, and social structures:

1. **Complementarity** - Paired aspects that seem opposite yet work together and can't be reduced to a single description.
2. **Self-Reference** - Processes that fold back on themselves, creating systems that can represent and model themselves.
3. **Scale-Recursion** - Similar patterns repeating across different scales, creating nested systems of organization.

## Why This Matters

This framework offers several notable benefits:

1. **Unmatched Explanatory Power** - Processism resolves persistent paradoxes that have challenged our understanding for centuries.
2. **Remarkable Parsimony** - While other frameworks require numerous concepts and special cases, Processism achieves extraordinary explanatory range with minimal conceptual components.
3. **Practical Applications** - Beyond its theoretical elegance, this framework offers practical approaches to complex challenges across disciplines.
