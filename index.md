# Processism: A Methodology for Pattern Discovery

## What We've Done

We developed a methodology to systematically analyze patterns across human knowledge using Large Language Models. Our goal: to discover what patterns appear most consistently in humanity's attempts to understand reality.

The result? Three patterns emerged with remarkable consistency across all domains we examined.

## What This Is

- 🔬 **A Methodology**: A systematic approach to finding patterns in collective human knowledge
- 📊 **A Set of Findings**: Three patterns that emerged from our analysis
- 🎯 **An Invitation**: To explore what these patterns might mean
- 🔍 **A Framework**: For viewing reality through a process lens

## What This Is Not

- ❌ A claim about ultimate truth
- ❌ A new religion or belief system
- ❌ A rejection of science
- ❌ A final answer to anything

## The Three Patterns We Found

Our analysis revealed three consistent patterns:

1. **Complementarity**: Apparent opposites that require each other
2. **Self-Reference**: Processes that act on themselves
3. **Scale-Invariance**: Patterns that repeat across scales

These patterns appeared across physics, biology, psychology, sociology, and every other domain we examined.

## Why This Might Matter

If these patterns reflect something real about reality (and that's for you to judge), they suggest:
- Reality might be better understood as process rather than things
- Many paradoxes might resolve when viewed through this lens
- New approaches to persistent problems might emerge
