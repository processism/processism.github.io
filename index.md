# Processism

## From Being to Becoming: A New Framework for Understanding Reality

Processism is a philosophical framework that shifts our focus from static entities to dynamic processes. Rather than seeing the world as composed of fixed "things," this framework reveals reality as an ongoing flow of processes, interactions, and recursive patterns.

## Core Principles

### Process

At the foundation of this framework is the recognition that what we perceive as stable objects are better understood as relatively stable patterns within ongoing processes. Like a whirlpool in a river, these patterns maintain their form despite constant change in their constituent elements.

### Interaction

No process exists in isolation. What anything "is" can only be understood through its interactions with other processes. These interactions don't merely connect pre-existing entities—they constitute the very nature of the processes themselves.

### Recursion

Systems that can observe and modify themselves introduce a recursive dimension. Through this recursion, processes can evolve in ways that transcend simple cause-and-effect relationships, creating emergent properties and complex adaptive behaviors.

## Beyond Traditional Frameworks

Processism represents a fundamental departure from traditional "entity-based" or "substance-based" ontologies that have dominated Western thought since Aristotle. Where traditional approaches ask "what things exist?", processism asks "what processes are occurring?"

This shift in perspective offers new approaches to persistent questions across multiple domains:

- **Metaphysics**: How can we understand identity through change?
- **Epistemology**: How does knowledge emerge through dynamic processes?
- **Ethics**: How should we act within constantly evolving systems?
- **Science**: How can we better model complex adaptive systems?

## An Evolving Framework

This site serves as a collaborative knowledge base for exploring and developing processism. Like the processes it describes, this framework is not static—it evolves through application, critique, and recursive refinement.

*This is version 0.1 of the framework, first published May 2025.*
