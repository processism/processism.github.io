# Processism: A Journey into Pattern Discovery

## Is This For You?

Are you curious about:
- Why certain patterns appear everywhere in nature and human experience?
- How reality might be more like a river than a collection of rocks?
- Why traditional approaches often hit the same walls?
- What connects quantum physics, consciousness, and social change?

If yes, you've found the right place. Processism offers a new lens for seeing patterns that hide in plain sight.

## What You'll Find Here

Processism emerged from a systematic search for patterns across all domains of human knowledge. What we discovered surprised us: three fundamental patterns that appear everywhere, from physics to psychology, from biology to business.

This isn't another philosophical system claiming to have all the answers. It's a methodologyâ€”a way of seeingâ€”that reveals connections and possibilities you might not have noticed before.
