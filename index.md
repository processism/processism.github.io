# Processism: Seeing Reality as It Really Is

> "No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man." — Heraclitus

## The Core Insight

**What if our most basic assumption about reality is backward?**

We naturally see the world as made of "things" that sometimes change. Processism proposes the opposite: reality is made of processes (ongoing change), and "things" are just stable patterns within these processes.

This simple inversion resolves paradoxes that have troubled thinkers for centuries.

## The PIR Framework

Building on [process philosophy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy) rich history, the **PIR Framework** offers a systematic approach through three interconnected principles:

<div class="principle-card">
  <div class="principle-header">Process</div>
  <div class="principle-content">
    "Things" are stable patterns maintained by ongoing processes—like a whirlpool persisting amid flowing water
  </div>
</div>

<div class="principle-card">
  <div class="principle-header">Interaction</div>
  <div class="principle-content">
    Properties emerge from relationships, not isolated entities—like how "teacher" and "student" roles emerge through educational interactions
  </div>
</div>

<div class="principle-card">
  <div class="principle-header">Recursion</div>
  <div class="principle-content">
    Systems modify themselves through feedback loops—like how your brain rewires itself as you learn new skills
  </div>
</div>

## Why This Matters: The Fundamental Asymmetry

The most compelling reason to consider this framework:

**Entity-based thinking struggles to explain change** (How do static things change?)  
**Process-based thinking naturally explains both change AND stability** (Stable patterns within processes)

This asymmetry creates explanatory power that extends from quantum physics to social systems.

## See For Yourself: The River and Whirlpool

Imagine a river with a whirlpool:
- The flowing water (process) creates and maintains the whirlpool pattern
- If the water stops flowing, the whirlpool disappears
- The whirlpool was never a separate "thing" but a pattern in the flow

**This simple shift in perspective changes everything.**
