# Processism: A New Lens for Understanding Reality

Processism is a philosophical framework that fundamentally shifts understanding from static entities to dynamic processes. Rather than seeing the world as made of "things" that interact and change, Processism proposes a more fundamental perspective:

## Core Principles

1. **Process**: Reality is fundamentally dynamic - processes are primary, and "things" are stable patterns within ongoing processes.

2. **Interaction**: Relationships precede and constitute the related - interactions come first, and what appear as separate "things" emerge from these interaction patterns.

3. **Recursion**: Systems modify themselves through feedback loops, enabling evolution and learning.

## The River-Whirlpool Example

Imagine a river with a whirlpool. Traditional thinking sees the whirlpool as a "thing" in the river. Processism sees it differently:
- The flowing water (process) creates and maintains the whirlpool pattern
- The interaction between water flow and riverbed features generates the whirlpool
- The whirlpool recursively modifies its own conditions (deepening its depression)

If the water stops flowing, the whirlpool disappears—revealing it was never a separate "thing" but a pattern maintained by processes.

## Why Processism Matters

This shift in perspective resolves persistent paradoxes and reveals new possibilities for understanding and intervening in complex systems. Where traditional approaches get stuck, Processism often reveals hidden leverage points and unexpected solutions.
