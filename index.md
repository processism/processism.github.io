# Processism: Reality as Process

> "No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man." — Heraclitus

## The Fundamental Insight

We naturally see the world as made of "things" that sometimes change. **Processism inverts this**: reality is made of processes (ongoing change), and "things" are stable patterns within these processes.

This single shift resolves paradoxes across science, philosophy, and everyday experience.

## The PIR Framework

Three interconnected principles form the foundation of this approach:

| Principle | Core Idea | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Process** | "Things" are stable patterns maintained by ongoing processes | A whirlpool exists only because water keeps flowing |
| **Interaction** | Properties emerge from relationships, not isolated entities | "Teacher" and "student" roles emerge through their relationship |
| **Recursion** | Systems modify themselves through feedback loops | Your brain rewires itself as you learn new skills |

## Start Here: The River and Whirlpool

To grasp the essence of processism, consider a river with a whirlpool:

1. The flowing water (process) creates and maintains the whirlpool pattern
2. The whirlpool looks like a "thing" but exists only because of ongoing flow
3. If the water stops flowing, the whirlpool disappears entirely
4. The whirlpool was never a separate "thing" but a pattern in the flow

**Now consider**: What if everything we call a "thing"—your body, your organization, your identity—is actually like that whirlpool?

## Why This Matters

The PIR framework offers practical advantages across domains:

- **More effective interventions** by focusing on processes that maintain patterns
- **Natural explanation of emergence** without mysterious forces or properties
- **Resolution of long-standing paradoxes** from identity to consciousness
- **Integration of insights** across physics, biology, cognition, and social systems
