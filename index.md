# Processism: Seeing Reality as It Really Is

> "No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man." — Heraclitus

## The Core Insight

**What if our most basic assumption about reality is backward?**

We naturally see the world as made of "things" that sometimes change. Processism proposes the opposite: reality is made of processes (ongoing change), and "things" are just stable patterns within these processes.

This simple inversion solves problems that have puzzled thinkers for centuries.

## The PIR Framework

While [process philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy) has ancient roots, the **PIR Framework** offers a powerful new synthesis:

1. **Process**: "Things" are stable patterns maintained by ongoing processes
2. **Interaction**: Properties emerge from relationships, not isolated entities
3. **Recursion**: Systems shape themselves through feedback loops

## The Fundamental Asymmetry

The most compelling reason to consider this framework:

**Entity-based thinking struggles to explain change** (how do static things change?)  
**Process-based thinking naturally explains both change AND stability** (stable patterns within processes)

## See For Yourself: The River and Whirlpool

Imagine a river with a whirlpool:
- The flowing water (process) creates and maintains the whirlpool pattern
- If the water stops flowing, the whirlpool disappears
- The whirlpool was never a separate "thing" but a pattern in the flow

**This simple shift in perspective changes everything.**

## Why This Matters

When you see the world as process rather than entity, previously intractable problems often reveal unexpected solutions. From quantum physics to personal development, from organizational change to artificial intelligence—this perspective reveals new possibilities.

The PIR Framework isn't just philosophy—it's a practical tool for navigating an increasingly complex world.
