# Processism in Plain Language

**Key Takeaway:** Processism suggests that reality is best understood as a recursive process that generates its own complexity through three key patterns: complementary aspects, self-reference, and similar organization across scales.

## What is Processism?

Processism is a framework for understanding reality that emerged from a systematic analysis of patterns across many domains of human knowledge.

Rather than seeing the world primarily as a collection of objects or separate domains, Processism views it as an integrated process that generates its own complexity through recursive patterns—patterns that repeat and build upon themselves.

## The Three Core Patterns

Our research identified three fundamental patterns that appear consistently across physics, biology, cognition, information systems, and social structures:

### 1. Complementarity
Across domains, we find paired aspects that seem opposite yet work together and can't be reduced to a single description.

**Everyday example:** Think about how you need both focus and peripheral awareness to drive safely, or how successful relationships require both autonomy and connection. These aren't contradictions—they're complementary aspects of the same process.

### 2. Self-Reference
Across domains, we find processes that fold back on themselves, creating systems that can represent and model themselves.

**Everyday example:** Your ability to think about your own thinking enables learning and growth. When you reflect on a past decision, you're experiencing self-reference. Social media is a technological expression of our self-referential nature.

### 3. Scale-Recursion
Across domains, we find similar patterns repeating across different scales, creating nested systems of organization.

**Everyday example:** Notice how team dynamics mirror organizational dynamics, which mirror societal dynamics. Or how your daily habits form weekly patterns, which create monthly patterns, which shape your life trajectory.

## Why This Matters

This framework offers several notable benefits:

### 1. Explanatory Power
Processism resolves persistent paradoxes that have challenged our understanding for centuries—not by adding complexity, but by revealing a more fundamental pattern.

### 2. Parsimony
While other frameworks require numerous concepts and special cases, Processism achieves extraordinary explanatory range with minimal conceptual components.

### 3. Practical Applications
Beyond its theoretical elegance, this framework offers practical approaches to complex challenges across disciplines.
