# Glossary

## Core Concepts

### Autopoiesis
*auto (self) + poiesis (creation)*
The process by which living systems continuously create and maintain themselves. A cell producing the components that produce the cell exemplifies autopoiesis.

### Becoming
The fundamental nature of reality as continuous change and process, contrasted with static "being." Everything is always becoming something else.

### Complementarity
The first pattern: apparently opposite or contradictory aspects that actually require and create each other. Examples: wave/particle, self/other, order/chaos.

### Dynamic Equilibrium
A state of balance maintained through continuous change and adjustment, like riding a bicycle or the stability of a whirlpool in flowing water.

### Emergence
The appearance of novel properties or patterns that arise from the interaction of simpler elements but cannot be predicted from those elements alone. Consciousness emerging from neurons exemplifies emergence.

<strong>Usage Note:</strong>
These terms often overlap and interconnect. Don't worry about rigid definitions—focus on understanding the flowing relationships between concepts.

## The Three Patterns

### Pattern
A recognizable configuration or relationship that appears across different contexts and scales. In Processism, patterns are more fundamental than things.

### Process
A sequence of changes or activities that constitute a coherent whole. In process thinking, reality consists of processes rather than static objects.

### Scale-Invariance
The third pattern: similar patterns appearing at different scales of observation. Fractals demonstrate scale-invariance, as do organizational hierarchies.

### Self-Reference
The second pattern: processes that act upon, modify, or refer to themselves. Consciousness being aware of itself is self-reference.

## Philosophical Terms

### Entity Thinking
The traditional Western approach of seeing reality as composed of things (entities) with properties, contrasted with process thinking.

### Metaphysics
The branch of philosophy dealing with the fundamental nature of reality. Process metaphysics sees reality as composed of events and processes rather than substances.

### Ontology
The study of being or existence. Process ontology studies becoming rather than being.

### Process Philosophy
The philosophical tradition, traced to Heraclitus and developed by Whitehead, that sees process as fundamentally real and things as abstractions from process.

### Substance
In traditional metaphysics, the unchanging essence underlying changing properties. Process thinking questions whether substances exist.

## Scientific Terms

### Complexity
The study of systems with many interacting parts that exhibit emergent properties. Complexity science often reveals process patterns.

### Dissipative Structure
A system that maintains itself far from equilibrium by dissipating energy, like a candle flame or living organism. Demonstrates process stability.

### Feedback Loop
A process where outputs become inputs, creating self-modifying behavior. Positive feedback amplifies change; negative feedback stabilizes.

### Nonlinearity
When effects are not proportional to causes, enabling small changes to have large effects and vice versa. Essential to understanding complex processes.

### Systems Thinking
An approach that focuses on wholes and relationships rather than parts in isolation. Naturally aligns with process thinking.

## Consciousness Terms

### Awareness
The basic capacity for experience or sentience. In process terms, awareness might be fundamental to reality, not emergent from matter.

### Flow State
A psychological state of complete immersion in activity where self-consciousness disappears and action-awareness merge. Exemplifies process consciousness.

### Metacognition
Thinking about thinking, or awareness of awareness. A form of self-reference central to human consciousness.

### Qualia
The subjective, experiential qualities of consciousness (the "redness" of red). Process thinking sees qualia as aspects of conscious process, not properties of things.

<strong>Glossary Practice:</strong>
Choose three related terms. Rather than memorizing definitions, explore how they connect and flow into each other as concepts.
</div>

## Practical Terms

### Leverage Point
A place in a system where small changes can produce large effects. Process thinking helps identify leverage points.

### Pattern Recognition
The ability to identify meaningful patterns in apparent chaos. Central to process thinking and practical application.

### Process Mapping
Visualizing the flows, transformations, and relationships in a system. A key tool for understanding and working with processes.

### Regenerative
Approaches that restore and enhance natural processes rather than merely sustaining or extracting from them.

## Eastern Concepts

### Anicca
Buddhist term for impermanence—the recognition that all phenomena are in constant flux. Foundational to process understanding.

### Dependent Origination
Buddhist concept that all phenomena arise in dependence upon conditions. Nothing exists independently.

### Tao
Chinese term meaning "way" or "path"—the fundamental process of reality that cannot be named or fixed.

### Wu Wei
Taoist principle of "effortless action"—working with natural processes rather than against them.

## Modern Applications

### Agile
Software development approach emphasizing iterative process, adaptation, and emergence over rigid planning.

### Biomimicry
Design approach that emulates natural processes and patterns to solve human challenges.

### Circular Economy
Economic system based on continuous flows of materials and energy, eliminating waste through process design.

### Resilience
The capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while maintaining function. A process property, not a fixed state.

<strong>Living Language:</strong>
This glossary is itself a process—terms evolve, meanings shift, new concepts emerge. Use it as a starting point, not a final authority.
</div>

## Meta-Terms

### Framework
A basic structure underlying a system or concept. Processism offers a framework for understanding reality as process.

### Paradigm
A fundamental model or pattern of thinking. Process thinking represents a paradigm shift from entity thinking.

### Perspective
A particular way of viewing things. Process thinking is a perspective that reveals patterns hidden from entity thinking.

### Worldview
A comprehensive conception of the universe and humanity's relation to it. Process philosophy offers a dynamic worldview.

## The Last Word

Remember: definitions are fingers pointing at the moon, not the moon itself. The map is not the territory. Let terms guide your understanding, but always return to direct experience of process.
