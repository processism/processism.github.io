# What is Processism?

## A Different Starting Point

Most of us see the world as made of things—objects that sometimes change and interact. Processism starts from a different premise: what if reality is made of processes (patterns of change), and what we call "things" are just relatively stable patterns within these processes?

This isn't just philosophical wordplay. This shift in perspective reveals patterns and possibilities that remain hidden when we think in terms of fixed entities.

<strong>Key Insight:</strong> Like a whirlpool in a river, what appears as a "thing" might actually be a pattern maintained by ongoing processes.
</div>

## The Origin Story

In early 2025, we set out to answer a question: If there are fundamental patterns underlying reality, shouldn't they appear consistently across different domains of knowledge?

We developed a methodology to systematically analyze patterns across:
- Physical sciences (physics, chemistry, astronomy)
- Life sciences (biology, ecology, evolution)
- Cognitive sciences (psychology, neuroscience, consciousness studies)
- Social sciences (sociology, anthropology, economics)
- Information sciences (computer science, mathematics, logic)

The result surprised us—three specific patterns appeared with remarkable consistency everywhere we looked.

## What We Found

</div>

The three patterns we discovered are:

1. **Complementarity**: Aspects that seem opposed but are mutually necessary
2. **Self-Reference**: Processes that act upon and modify themselves
3. **Scale-Invariance**: Similar patterns repeating at different scales

These aren't just abstract concepts. They appear in:
- How particles behave in quantum physics
- How consciousness emerges in brains
- How societies evolve and change
- How ecosystems maintain balance
- How learning and creativity work

## Why It Matters

When you shift from seeing things to seeing processes, previously unsolvable problems often reveal new solutions.

<strong>Try This:</strong> Think about a persistent problem in your life. Instead of asking "How do I fix this thing?" ask "What processes maintain this pattern?" Notice how this shift opens new possibilities.

## What Processism Is Not

Let's be clear about what we're not claiming:

- ❌ A religion or belief system
- ❌ A claim to ultimate truth
- ❌ A rejection of scientific knowledge
- ❌ A form of mysticism
- ❌ A complete philosophical system

## What Processism Is

Processism is:

- ✓ A methodology for recognizing patterns
- ✓ A different lens for viewing reality
- ✓ A practical tool for understanding complex systems
- ✓ An invitation to explore
- ✓ A work in progress, open to refinement

## The Journey Ahead

This website presents our findings as a journey of discovery. You'll explore:
- How we found these patterns
- What they mean in different domains
- How to apply them practically
- What questions they raise
- Where they might lead

We present this not as doctrine but as an exploration. We invite you to examine the patterns yourself, test them against your experience, and see what you discover.

<div class="key-insight">
<strong>Remember:</strong> Processism isn't about accepting new beliefs. It's about noticing patterns that are already there, waiting to be seen.
