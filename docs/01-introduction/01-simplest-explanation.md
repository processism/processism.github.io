# The Simplest Explanation of PIR

Have you ever tried to change something—a habit, a team, a relationship—only to find it snapping back to its old patterns? That's because we've been taught to see the world backward.

## What Is PIR?

PIR stands for **P**rocess, **I**nteraction, and **R**ecursion. It's a way of understanding reality that flips our usual thinking upside down.

Most of us were taught to see the world as made of "things" that sometimes change. PIR suggests the opposite: the world is made of changes and flows (processes), and what we call "things" are just patterns that stay consistent for a while.

## The Three Big Ideas

### 1. Process: Everything Flows
What looks like a stable "thing" is actually a pattern maintained by ongoing processes.

**Example:** A whirlpool in a river looks like a distinct object, but it's actually water continuously flowing through a circular pattern. If the river stops flowing, the whirlpool disappears. The whirlpool isn't a "thing" - it's a pattern in the flow.

**Personal Example:** You're not the same person you were five years ago. Nearly every cell in your body has been replaced, yet "you" persist as a pattern maintained by ongoing biological processes.

### 2. Interaction: Relationships Create Reality
What something "is" depends on what it's interacting with. Properties emerge from relationships, not from isolated things.

**Example:** A person isn't inherently a "teacher" - this role emerges through interactions with students, educational systems, and learning materials. The same person becomes something different (parent, friend, customer) in different interaction contexts.

### 3. Recursion: Systems Shape Themselves
Systems modify themselves through feedback loops, enabling learning and evolution.

**Example:** When learning to play guitar, your attempts create feedback (how it sounds), which modifies your next attempts. Your brain literally rewires itself based on this feedback. The learning system (you) modifies itself through its own activity.

## Try This Right Now

Take 10 seconds: Look at your hand. Traditional thinking says it's a thing. PIR reveals it's billions of cells constantly being replaced, energy flowing, atoms vibrating - all maintaining a pattern you call "hand." What if everything is like this?

## The River and Whirlpool: Understanding It All Together

Imagine a river with a whirlpool:

- **Process:** The flowing water creates and maintains the whirlpool pattern
- **Interaction:** The whirlpool emerges from interactions between water flow, riverbed shape, and obstacles
- **Recursion:** The whirlpool deepens its depression in the riverbed over time, making itself more stable

## Traditional vs. PIR Thinking

| Traditional Thinking | PIR Thinking |
|---------------------|--------------|
| "I need to fix this team" | "I need to change the processes maintaining this team pattern" |
| "Why won't my habit change?" | "What feedback loops reinforce this habit?" |

## Why This Matters: Photography vs. Video

Traditional thinking is like trying to understand a soccer game from a photograph. You see frozen players, but miss what's actually happening - the game itself.

- **Traditional thinking** is like a photograph - the world appears as static objects that occasionally change
- **PIR thinking** is like a video - everything is constantly in motion, and what we call "things" are patterns that maintain consistency from frame to frame

Pick any "thing" in your surroundings - maybe your coffee mug, your organization, or even your career. Ask yourself:

1. **Process question:** What ongoing processes maintain this pattern? If those processes stopped, would this "thing" still exist?

2. **Interaction question:** How does this emerge from relationships? How would it be different in another context?

3. **Recursion question:** How does this modify itself over time? What feedback loops are at work?

## The Key Insight: The Fundamental Asymmetry

Traditional "thing-based" thinking struggles to explain how things change. If things are primary, change becomes mysterious.

PIR thinking naturally explains both change AND stability. If processes are primary, stable patterns emerge naturally as processes maintain themselves.

When you see through the PIR lens, previously tough problems often reveal simple solutions. Instead of pushing harder against resistance, you can identify and shift the underlying processes.

## In Daily Life: From Coffee to Organizations

### Coffee
- Not a "thing" but a pattern of water flowing through grounds, extracting compounds
- Properties emerge from interactions between water, beans, temperature, and time
- Coffee culture evolves as techniques modify themselves through feedback

### Organizations
- Not static entities but ongoing patterns of coordination and collaboration
- Roles and structures emerge from interactions between people, resources, and environments
- Organizations modify themselves through learning, adaptation, and evolution

## Five Simple Ways to Practice PIR Thinking

1. **Notice processes** - What flows and movements maintain the patterns around you?
2. **Explore interactions** - How do different elements create something new when they come together?
3. **Find feedback loops** - Where do you see systems changing themselves?
4. **Compress time mentally** - How would slow-moving patterns look if you could see them like a time-lapse video?
5. **Visual exercise** - When looking at a building, try to "see" the invisible processes maintaining it—electricity flowing, materials responding to weather, people giving it purpose

## Liberation Through Process

There's something profoundly freeing about seeing the world as process. Nothing is fixed. Everything—including yourself—is in constant creation. Problems become opportunities for redirecting flow rather than battles against solid obstacles.

This shift isn't just philosophical—it's practical. Throughout this site, you'll discover how seeing through the PIR lens can transform everything from personal habits to organizations, from science to relationships. 

What becomes possible when you see reality as it actually is?
