# Processism vs. Entity-Based Thinking: Bridging Two Worldviews

## Two Ways of Seeing Reality

Throughout history, humans have tried to make sense of reality. The most common approach—so embedded in our thinking that we rarely question it—is what we call **entity-based thinking**. This worldview sees reality as fundamentally made of "things" (entities) that sometimes interact and change.

**Processism** offers a profound alternative: reality is fundamentally made of processes (dynamic patterns of change), and what we call "things" are stable patterns within these ongoing processes.

This distinction isn't merely academic. It transforms how we understand everything from physical objects to organizations, from personal identity to social change. Let's explore the bridge between these worldviews.

## The Core Differences

| Aspect | Entity-Based Thinking | Processism (PIR Framework) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Primary reality** | Objects/things/entities | Processes/patterns/flows |
| **Change** | Something that happens to things | The fundamental nature of reality |
| **Stability** | The natural state | A pattern maintained by processes |
| **Identity** | Fixed and inherent | Maintained through continuous processes |
| **Causality** | A leads to B | Patterns emerge from process interactions |
| **Boundaries** | Fixed and definite | Maintained by active processes |
| **Problems** | Fix broken components | Modify patterns and flows |

## The Paradigm Shift Through Examples

### Physical Example: A River and Its Whirlpool

**Entity View**: A river contains a whirlpool, which is a distinct object within the water.

**Process View**: The flowing water (process) creates and maintains the whirlpool pattern. The whirlpool isn't a separate "thing" but a stable pattern within the ongoing flow. If the water stops flowing, the whirlpool disappears—revealing it was never a separate entity but a process pattern.

### Biological Example: Your Body

**Entity View**: Your body is a physical object that you possess and that undergoes changes over time.

**Process View**: Your body is a pattern maintained by countless processes—metabolism, circulation, cell regeneration, immune function. Every atom in your body will be replaced many times throughout your life. What persists isn't material but pattern—maintained by these processes.

### Organization Example: A Company

**Entity View**: A company is an entity with properties (employees, assets, products) that it possesses.

**Process View**: A company is an ongoing pattern of coordinated activities. It exists only through continuous processes of production, communication, resource flow, and decision-making. If these processes stopped, the "company" would cease to exist, even if buildings and assets remained.

### Social Example: A Marriage

**Entity View**: Marriage is a status or state that two people enter into and can exit from.

**Process View**: Marriage is an ongoing process of relating, growing, and adapting together. It exists through daily interactions, shared experiences, and continuous renewal. The health of a marriage depends on the quality of these processes, not just on its legal status.

## The Fundamental Asymmetry: Why This Matters

The most compelling reason to consider processism is what we call the "fundamental asymmetry":

**Entity frameworks struggle to explain change, while process frameworks naturally accommodate stability.**

If you start with static entities as fundamental, you must add change as something extra and mysterious. This creates paradoxes and explanatory gaps.

If you start with processes as fundamental, stability naturally emerges as certain process patterns maintain themselves. Both change and stability are explained within a single framework.

This asymmetry is why processism often reveals solutions to problems that resist entity-based approaches.

## Side-By-Side Approaches to Common Challenges

| Challenge | Entity-Based Approach | Process-Based Approach |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Team dysfunction** | Identify "problem people" and replace them | Modify communication flows and interaction patterns |
| **Chronic health issue** | Target the "broken part" with intervention | Support the body's natural healing processes |
| **Environmental degradation** | Add technological fixes to damaged areas | Restore ecological process flows and relationships |
| **Student learning struggle** | Identify knowledge gaps and fill them | Redesign the learning process and engagement patterns |
| **Business decline** | Cut costs and restructure departments | Modify value creation processes and customer interactions |
| **Personal identity crisis** | Find your "true self" | Recognize identity as an evolving process and nurture its development |

## Common Objections and Responses

### "But things clearly exist! I can touch them!"

**Response**: Processism doesn't deny the reality of what we experience—it reframes how we understand that reality. The solidity you feel when touching objects exists, but it arises from ongoing processes (electromagnetic forces between atoms, sensory processes in your nervous system). The stability of patterns doesn't make them non-processes.

### "Process thinking seems too abstract and impractical."

**Response**: While the concept may initially seem abstract, process thinking often leads to more practical solutions. When we focus on processes rather than entities, we discover leverage points for change that entity-thinking misses. The case studies throughout this site demonstrate the practical power of process approaches.

### "If everything is process, how can we make sense of anything?"

**Response**: Processism doesn't abandon categories or deny stability—it explains them differently. Stable patterns definitely exist, but they exist as processes maintaining themselves, not as static entities. This actually makes more sense of our experience than the traditional view, which struggles to explain how supposedly static things change.

## Transitioning to Process Thinking: First Steps

1. **Practice entity-to-process translation**
   - For any "thing," ask: "What processes maintain this pattern?"
   - If those processes stopped, would the "thing" persist?
   - Example: Instead of "this is a tree," try "this is a growing, photosynthesizing, water-circulating pattern."

2. **Focus on flows and transformations**
   - Notice what's flowing through systems (information, energy, materials)
   - Identify where transformations occur
   - Example: In a conversation, trace how ideas flow, transform, and re-emerge

3. **Observe interaction patterns**
   - Notice how different contexts create different behaviors
   - Identify what emerges from interactions that wasn't present in the separate elements
   - Example: Watch how the same person behaves differently in different social contexts

4. **Spot feedback loops**
   - Identify how systems act upon themselves
   - Notice patterns that amplify or stabilize themselves
   - Example: Observe how habits strengthen themselves through repetition

## The Core Asymmetry in Action: A Simple Demonstration

Consider this challenge: "How do I maintain a productive team when team members keep changing?"

**Entity Approach**: Focuses on replacing departing members with similar individuals, documenting procedures so new members can follow them, and preserving the team's identity despite turnover.

**Process Approach**: Focuses on creating robust onboarding flows, maintaining healthy communication patterns, and designing feedback loops that allow the team to learn and adapt through membership changes.

Notice how the entity approach struggles to reconcile stability with change, while the process approach naturally accommodates both the continuous flow of people and the maintenance of team capabilities.

## Conclusion: Not Either/Or But Both/And

Processism doesn't ask you to abandon entity-based thinking entirely—it's too embedded in our language and practical affairs. Instead, it offers a complementary perspective that reveals aspects of reality that entity-thinking cannot capture.

The goal is to develop the ability to shift between perspectives as needed:
- Entity thinking works well for stable, simple contexts
- Process thinking reveals solutions in dynamic, complex situations

By developing fluency in both, you gain the ability to see reality more completely and address challenges more effectively.
