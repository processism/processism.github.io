# Processism Resources

**Key Takeaway:** This section provides supporting materials to help you understand and apply Processism concepts, including visual explanations, terminology definitions, and suggested reading.

## Visual Explanations

Visual representations can make abstract concepts more accessible. Here you'll find diagrams and visualizations of key Processism concepts.

### Core Framework Visuals

{% include svg/concepts/three-aspects.svg %}

The three fundamental aspects of Processism: Complementarity (self-differentiation), Self-Reference (self-relation), and Scale-Recursion (self-integration).

## Terminology Glossary

Processism introduces some specialized terminology. This glossary provides clear definitions of key terms.

### Core Terms

**Processism**  
A framework that models reality as a recursive process manifesting through complementarity, self-reference, and scale-recursion.

**Complementarity**  
The aspect of reality that manifests through paired elements that appear opposed yet work together and cannot be reduced to each other.

**Self-Reference**  
The aspect of reality where processes fold back upon themselves, creating systems that can represent and model themselves.

**Scale-Recursion**  
The aspect of reality where similar patterns manifest across different scales of organization, creating nested systems.

## Further Reading

While Processism represents a novel synthesis, it connects to several rich intellectual traditions. These resources provide additional context and depth.

### Related Frameworks

Several existing frameworks have points of connection with Processism:

- **Process Philosophy**: Focuses on becoming rather than being, with key works by Heraclitus, Whitehead, and Rescher
- **Systems Theory**: Studies interconnected components and emergence, developed by Bertalanffy, Meadows, and others
- **Complexity Science**: Examines self-organizing, adaptive systems, with contributions from Holland, Kauffman, and Gell-Mann
- **Information Theory**: Explores information as fundamental, from Shannon to Wheeler's "it from bit"
- **Autopoiesis**: Studies self-creating systems, developed by Maturana and Varela

### Interdisciplinary Connections

Processism connects to developments across multiple fields:

- **Physics**: Complementarity in quantum mechanics, scale invariance in critical phenomena
- **Biology**: Autopoiesis, development and evolution as recursive processes
- **Cognitive Science**: Embodied cognition, predictive processing, consciousness studies
- **Computer Science**: Recursive algorithms, self-modifying systems, neural networks
- **Organizational Theory**: Complex adaptive systems, Teal organizations, Agile approaches
